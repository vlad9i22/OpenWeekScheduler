# OpenWeekScheduler
The project is a tool to efficiently plan next week. The main idea is to connect your goals to your roles that you're performing through out your life. The parts of this approach are decribed in the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey.

# Workflow of website
When adding a new week you will be transfered to page to fill roles and goles for the current week. After you finished you will be transfered to the page where you will put your goals through out the week.
You will be able to highlight accomplished goals with green and failed goals with red.
